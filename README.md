## Implementation
A customised `OpenfoamRun` class has been created which automatically does the following:

* Uploads the input files stored in the Constant and System directories, as well as the initial conditions in the 0 directory, as input artifacts
* Uploads the Allrun script as a code artifact
* Uploads information from the top of the log files, such as the OpenFOAM build used, as metadata
* Uploads information from the log files before the solve begins to the events log
* Tracks the residuals being calculated for each parameter as metrics
* Once complete, uploads all of the outputs for each time step as output artifacts

The `OpenfoamRun` class also inherits from the `Run()` class of the Simvue Python API, allowing for further detailed control over how your simulation is tracked.

## Installation
To install and use this connector, first create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```
Then activate it:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
And then use pip to install this module:
```
pip install simvue-openfoam
```

## Configuration
The service URL and token can be defined as environment variables:
```sh
export SIMVUE_URL=...
export SIMVUE_TOKEN=...
```
or a file `simvue.toml` can be created containing:
```toml
[server]
url = "..."
token = "..."
```
The exact contents of both of the above options can be obtained directly by clicking the **Create new run** button on the web UI. Note that the environment variables have preference over the config file.

## Usage example

```python
from simvue_openfoam.connector import OpenfoamRun

...

if __name__ == "__main__":

    ...

    # Using a context manager means that the status will be set to completed automatically,
    # and also means that if the code exits with an exception this will be reported to Simvue
    with OpenfoamRun() as run:

        # Specify a run name, along with any other optional parameters:
        run.init(
          name = 'my-openfoam-simulation',                              # Run name
          metadata = {'angle_of_attack': 30},                           # Metadata
          tags = ['fds', 'airfoil', '2D'],                              # Tags
          description = 'OpenFOAM simulation of a 2D airfoil.',         # Description
          folder = '/openfoam/airfoil2D/trial_1'                        # Folder path
        )

        # Set folder details if necessary
        run.set_folder_details(
          metadata = {'simulation_type': 'airfoil2D'},             # Metadata
          tags = ['openfoam'],                                     # Tags
          description = 'OpenFOAM simulations of airfoils'         # Description
        )

        # Can use the base Simvue Run() methods to upload extra information, eg:
        run.save_file(os.path.abspath(__file__), "code")

        # Can add alerts specific to your simulation, eg:
        run.create_metric_threshold_alert(
          name='ux_residuals_too_high',           # Name of Alert
          metric='residuals.initial.Ux',          # Metric to monitor
          frequency=1,                            # Frequency to evaluate rule at (mins)
          rule="is above",                        # Rule to alert on
          threshold=0.1,                          # Threshold to alert on
          notification='email',                   # Notification type
          trigger_abort=True                      # Abort simulation if triggered
        )

        # Launch the OpenFOAM simulation
        run.launch(
            openfoam_case_dir='path/to/my/openfoam/case',   # Path to your OpenFOAM case directory
            upload_as_zip=True,                              # Whether to upload inputs & results as zip files
            )

```
